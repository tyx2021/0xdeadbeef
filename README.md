## Repo format
Create seperate folders for each cat, and each chall. Inside the folder for every chall:
- src (The files you used to generate the challenge files, and the files that will be running on the server if you're doing a remote chall)
- dist (Distribution files, the files that should be given to participants)
- solve (Solve scripts/Writeups, optional)
