A string concealed in moonlit shade,  
With slashes, plusses deftly laid.  
Decode the veil, let bytes reveal,  
The whispered truth the glyphs conceal.  

Now split the stream in trios neat,  
Each line a rhythm, each beat complete.  
Twelve fragments wait in cloaks reversed,  
Like echoes penned in secret verse.  

A key once simple, now disguised,  
Its letters base64 revised.  
From 'a' to 'l', let numbers rise,  
To weave the order, linewise ties.  

Now bind them close, in ordered frame,  
Restore the pulse, reveal the name.  
The flag you seek begins to shineâ€”  
A riddle cracked, one verse, one line.
