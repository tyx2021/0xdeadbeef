A scrambled tale of secrets deep,  
Twelve lines reversed, no time for sleep.  
The cipher sings in fractured rhyme,  
Its order lost, obscured by time.  

A key you hold — just letters plain,  
But each conceals a numbered chain.  
From 'a' to 'l', their values lie,  
To guide the pieces you must try.  

Look not at words, but how they bend,  
Each line reversed from start to end.  
Then follow paths the key reveals,  
To trace the truth the flag conceals.  

Combine the strings as orders change,  
A simple shift, a subtle range.  
And when it’s done, reverse once more —  
The flag awaits you at the door.
